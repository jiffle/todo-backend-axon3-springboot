Todo Backend Axon
=========================
An implementation of [Todo Backend](http://www.todobackend.com/) with [Axon Framework](http://www.axonframework.org/) + [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

Axon is a [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) Framework for Java. Though it is not the best candidate for 
building a simple ToDo application, I chose it in order to learn the framework while applying CQRS to a known domain.

*This implementation of the Todo Backend "cheats" by using an in-memory object as the data store.*
